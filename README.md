# Project Description

This project is an embedded systems mini-project focused on PIC microcontroller drivers. 

It involves developing drivers and configurations for PIC microcontrollers for various applications. 

The project is based on Layer architecture and includes the following layers:

- Application Layer
- Microcontroller Abstraction Layer
- Electronic Control Unit Layer
